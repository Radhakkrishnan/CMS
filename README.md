# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- I have developed a full-stack web application that allows users to log in and manage a list of students. The application provides functionality to view, add, update, and delete student details seamlessly. It is built with a robust backend connected to a PostgreSQL database for efficient data handling and storage, ensuring reliability and scalability.  This project showcases my ability to integrate frontend, backend, and database systems effectively, demonstrating a complete full-stack development workflow.
